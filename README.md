What the project does:

This is a simple time caluclator that uses moment.JS and Firebase as the database. A user can add different train times that will append to the scheduler and show the remaining time until the next train arrives.

Why the project is useful:

This was a good way to dive into moment.JS and Firebase. Along with continual practice of using Javascript and Jquery for DOM manipulation.

Who maintains and contributes to the project:

Myself.
